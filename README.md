Fig-1: Bar chart showing the total amount of games each champion was used in during the tournament. This visualization highlights the meta at the time of the championship as well as which champions professional players find most vital to a successful team composition. The 5 most popular champions were Kai'Sa (71), Lee Sin (58), Xayah (57), Nautilus (52), and Gragas (49).

Fig-2: Scatter plot showing the total amount of games each champion won during the tournament. Paired with the bar chart this visualization is important to be able to see the amount of games won by each of the most popular champions. It stands to reason that the most used champion in the entirety of the tournament Kai'Sa also has the highest win share of games. However although this champion led by far with most games played their wins end up much closer to the other lesser played champions than one would initially expect.

Fig-3: A pie chart showing the overall win rate of some of the more prominent champions used during the tournament. Although Gragas is the least popular of the top champions he has the highest win rate percentage even when compared to Nautilus who appeared in a similar amount of matches

Fig-4: I attempted to create a line graph showing losses per champion and wins per champions but was unsuccessful due to needing continuous data which my data set did not have. Ideally this would have been able to properly exemplify win rate for each of the 10 most used champions in the tournament.
